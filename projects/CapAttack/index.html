				<p>Curious to know how a neural network model transitions from development/experimentation to
					production, I spent a few weekends working on a personal project exploring this. The end product is
					a trained neural network deployed to a web service which classifies mushroom edibility. I pulled
					a mushroom edibility classification dataset from Kaggle and developed a neural network model in
					Tensorflow which was trained and evaluated on the previously mentioned dataset.

					The model was a simple fully connected neural network with 3 hidden layers. The classification task
					was binary classification for 'edible' or 'poisonous'.

					After successfully achieving an accuracy of 95% for the trained model, I saved it's model weights
					for later usage for inference. I then created a predict api via Flask which downloads the trained
					model, provides input from a user, and returns a prediction. I utilized Dash to implement a simple
					front end interface for a user to input attributes about a specific mushroom they were curious
					about. Upon submission of this user input, they would receive back a classification result,
					indicating if the mushroom they input was edible or not.

					After this, I created separate Docker containers for the various components of my app. I then
					utilized Docker compose in order to orchestrate the various Docker containers to serve their
					individual purposes.

					I then created an AWS EC2 instance to host my project. The entier project, incluing the Docker files
					were cloned from Github to this instance and the containers were started. My app was now accessible
					online and was at this point deployed. I then created a unique domain name to better identify the
					project
					online.

					The model utilized in this project was simple and the task it was used for was simply binary
					classification but it was not the focus of this project. I wanted to learn about what it takes to
					take a model to production and that is what I did.

					There are many improvements I could make to this project going forward. Here are a few thoughts
					about improvement. I could use an ML lifecycle management tool such as MLFlow to better keep track
					of my model trainings and develop a model registry to track production ready models in a repository.
					Doing this would provide a better model storage solution as well as a solution for model versioning
					and tracking. I could use a CI/CD tool such as Github Actions in order to automate the continuous
					integration and continous delivery/deployment of my codebase. I could utilize Kubernetes in order to
					have a cluster of containers running rather than a single instance, this would help with load
					balancing in high traffic situations. I could scale up my data and utilize a managed database
					service in order to have a better solution for data management.
