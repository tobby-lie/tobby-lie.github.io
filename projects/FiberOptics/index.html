				<h1 class="major">Fiber Optics Research</h1>
				<p>This topic is of importance as it is one of the most crucial transmission mediums utilized across the
					internet. Optical fiber is the most important type of media that uses light (Comer 119). Compared to
					copper wiring which is also a widely utilized transmission medium in networks, optical fiber offers
					characteristics that copper wiring cannot compete with. Optical fiber is immune to electrical noise,
					has higher bandwidth and light traveling across a fiber does not attenuate as much as electrical
					signals traveling across copper (Comer 121). Consider an example of a landline telephone, a fiber
					optic strand is thicker than a human hair and can carry approximately 25,000 phone calls. Fiber
					optic cables can carry information over great distances safely. They are utilized in multiple
					domains as well such as computer networking, the medical field, cable TV and military and space
					applications (Moscalu).
